    <p>
      I'm <strong>Arashpreet Kaur</strong>, a dedicated student pursuing <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> at <strong>Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana</strong>. I’ve just completed my <strong>first year</strong> and am currently <strong>awaiting results</strong> as I prepare to step confidently into my second year.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic journey so far has introduced me to a wide range of subjects — Technical,Foundational as well as Programming   </p>

    <p>
      During my recent training program, I got hands-on exposure to important technical skills. I learned about the <strong>Linux command line</strong>, explored <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> for web development, and studied the basics of <strong>Operating Systems</strong> and <strong>Computer Hardware</strong>. These experiences have sparked my interest in both software and system-level concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy learning through experimentation, projects, and problem-solving. My goal is to continue building my skills in programming, explore new technologies, and take part in creative and collaborative opportunities. As I enter my second year, I’m excited to dive into <strong>Data Structures</strong>, <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>, and more advanced development practices.
